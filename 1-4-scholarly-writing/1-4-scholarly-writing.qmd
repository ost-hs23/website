# Four terms

- Citation
- Reference
- Bibliography
- Citation Style Language (CSL)

## What's a Citation?

::: {.incremental}

- Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [@kalina2023rich].
- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [@tilley2021my].
- In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.

::: 

::: {.notes}
**Explanation**
A citation is a reference to the source of information used in your research. Any time you directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize the essential elements of someone else's idea in your work, an in-text citation should follow. For example, in APA style, a citation might look like this: (Tilley and Kalina, 2021). 

**Analogy**
Think of a citation as a signpost on a road trip. It tells you where the information came from and points you in the direction of the full details (the destination), which can be found in the reference list.

**Explanation**

A reference is a detailed description of the source of information that you want to give credit to via a citation. In APA style, a reference provides comprehensive details about a source, including the author's name, the title of the source, the year of publication, and the publisher or URL.

**Analogy**

A reference is like a detailed map at the end of your road trip (paper). It provides all the details about the source (destination) that the citation (signpost) pointed to.

## What's a Bibliography?

::: large

- list of references in a research paper or project
- includes all sources used, whether they were directly quoted or not
- listed alphabetically by the author's last name in the reference list

## What's the Citation Style Language (CSL)?

::: {.notes}
The Citation Style Language (CSL) describes the formatting of citations, notes, and bibliographies. It was created to provide an open format that can be used by any application

## Why use a reference management tool?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Managing references manually:

- is a lot of work 
- is prone to mistakes
- makes you lose track
