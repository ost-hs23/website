# Anatomy of a Quarto project

## Quarto projects

-   Quarto projects have a `_quarto.yml` file

-   The `type` field in this file indicates the type of project:

    -   `default`: Collection of documents

    -   `website`: Websites (and blogs)

    -   `books`: Books ðŸ˜ƒ

## Quarto websites

-   Websites are essentially `format: html` + a Quarto Project

-   But a website is different than `format: html` in that it has multiple pages

-   Websites are our first exploration into Quarto Projects

-   Websites and books are very similar in that they associate multiple pages/resources into a connected resource

## Our turn

::: task
Let's build a website together from scratch. We will highlight the following feautures of Quarto websites:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` & `about.qmd` / landing page / change landing page

-   Navigation

-   Freeze

-   An aspect of the workshop webpage that you fancy?
