Do a brief online literature research and find three scientific articles that you would use to write this paragraph. As part of this literature research, do the following:\n\n### Part 1\n\n1.  Open Zotero\n2.  Under Groups, right-click 'ost-hs23' \\> New Collection ...\n3.  Use your GitHub username as the name for the collection\n4.  Hit OK\n\n### Part 2\n\n1.  Open the browser for which you installed the Zotero Connector (if you did not yet install the Zotero Connector, head back to the [pre-course work for Zotero](https://ost-hs23.github.io/website/0-2-pre-work/03-zotero.html#install-the-zotero-connector-for-your-browser))\n\n2.  Open the web pages that show the three scientific articles you want to store in your bibliography. Try to open the original page of the publisher (e.g. [\"My Flight Arrives at 5 am, Can You Pick Me Up?\": The Gatekeeping Burden of the African Academic](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696815.2021.1884972)).\n\n3.  Find your Zotero Connector Add-on. It's often placed in the top right of your browser.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Zotero Connector for Safari users\n\nZotero Connector for Safari is bundled with the Zotero 6 desktop app.\n\nSee here how to activate it: <https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/safari_compatibility>\n:::\n\n4.

The scientific article is stored as a reference your Zotero app and sorted into the Collection that you have selected.\n\n7. Repeat this process for the other two articles that you selected.\n\n### Part 3\n\n1. Head back to the Zotero app\n2. Right-click your Collection\n3. Click Export Collection\n4. Under 'Format', select Better BibTeX\n5. Keep all checkboxes unselected (see @fig-export)\n6. Save the exported .bib file to a local folder of your choice\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## Better BibTeX format not available?\nIf the Better BibTeX format is not available for you, head back to the pre-course work assignment for Zotero and setup the Add-on:\n\n<https://ost-hs23.github.io/website/0-2-pre-work/03-zotero.html#setup-add-ons-and-the-citation-key-format>\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Export a Zotero Collection in Better BibTeX format](images/screenshot-better-bibtex.png){#fig-export width=186}\n:::\n:::\n",
