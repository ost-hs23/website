That ID is added to the Caption below the table as shown here:\n\n@tbl-label works.\n\n| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n|      |      |\n|      |      |\n\n: This is a caption {#tbl-label}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.  Create a 2 row x 2 column table, populate with a column for restaurant + column for cuisine. Then, cross reference it from text.\n\n2.  Include the Quarto logo from the `images/` folder as a figure. Add a caption, id, and cross-reference to the figure.\n\n3.  **Stretch goal:** Add a caption, label, and cross-reference to the figure generated from the code below.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.618'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = penguins,\n       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     color = species,\n                     shape = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_colorblind() +\n  labs(x = \"Bill length (mm)\", y = \"Bill depth (mm)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-tables-and-figures_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n",
