Any time you directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize the essential elements of someone else's idea in your work, an in-text citation should follow. For example, in APA style, a citation might look like this: (Tilley and Kalina, 2021). \n\n**Analogy**\nThink of a citation as a signpost on a road trip. It tells you where the information came from and points you in the direction of the full details (the destination), which can be found in the reference list.\n:::\n\n## What's a Citation?\n\n- Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [[@kalina2023rich].]{.highlight-yellow}\n- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [[@tilley2021my].]{.highlight-yellow}\n- In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Important: The period is **after** the citation.\n:::\n\n## What's a Reference?\n\n- detailed description of the source of information\n- author's name, title, year of publication, publisher, DOI, etc.\n\nTilley, E., & Kalina, M.

In APA style, a reference provides comprehensive details about a source, including the author's name, the title of the source, the year of publication, and the publisher or URL.\n\n**Analogy**\n\nA reference is like a detailed map at the end of your road trip (paper). It provides all the details about the source (destination) that the citation (signpost) pointed to.\n\n::: \n\n\n\n## What's a Bibliography?\n\n::: large\n\n- list of references in a research paper or project\n- includes all sources used, whether they were directly quoted or not\n- listed alphabetically by the author's last name in the reference list\n\n:::\n\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n## What's the Citation Style Language (CSL)?\n\n- It's what your citation and generated bibliography look like\n- APA (American Psychological Association) Style, Chicago Style, IEEE Style, Vancouver Style, etc. (over 10,000 styles in [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles))\n\n::: {.notes}\nThe Citation Style Language (CSL) describes the formatting of citations, notes, and bibliographies.
