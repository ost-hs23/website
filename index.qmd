Thank you for your interest in this course. Your course instructor [Lars Schöbitz](https://ghe.ethz.ch/about/people/person-detail.MjkyODc2.TGlzdC80MTI2LC0xNDYwMDMwNTU3.html) is looking forward to meet you. 

We will meet in Room HG F 33.5 at the following times:

Please ensure you bring the following items to class:
